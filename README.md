# Facebook Clone Application

## Technologies Used

* Next.js
* TypeScript
* TailwindCSS
* Redux

## Data source
I built this application pulling data from the following API: https://dummyjson.com/

## Installation 
To run this application locally, follow these steps: 
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/DanteGrippaldi/facebook_clone.git
2. Install dependancies: 'npm install'
3. Start the development server: 'npm run dev'

### PLEASE NOTE

This is an ongoing project I will be using for my portolio. I am aware there may be a few bugs here and there. I have decided to deploy this application anyways so that potential employers can have a reference to my work :). Enjoy!

## Live Demo

This site is hosted with Netlify's free plan -- please allow at least 30 seconds for all the data to load correctly due to the free plan :).

Live demo: [`Facebook Clone`](https://effervescent-creponne-402ec4.netlify.app/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
